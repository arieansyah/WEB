                Sister Tour was established in 2015. It’s pretty new – indeed!

                We are a local organization to create a system that will plan your trip to Borneo Central Kalimantan, Indonesia.
                <br>
                However, we set up Tours To Borneo not only for our money tree. 
                We’re inspired by the idea of sustainable and responsible tourism. 
                Unfortunately, we don’t know yet how to put this brilliant idea into action.
                If you have any knowledge in this area, we would appreciate you sharing your knowledge and ideas with us. 
                Together with you, we can drive tourism to support maintenance of this beautiful world.
                <br>

                attractive holiday!!!
